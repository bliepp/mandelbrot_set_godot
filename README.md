# Mandelbrot Set (Godot Engine)
A fast shader to visualize the mandelbrot set written in the Godot Shader Language.

It basically consists of an ColorRect with a shader applied to it. Since Godot shaders until now only support single precision floats (no doubles) the zoom comes to an end very quickly. Nevertheless it is a pretty fast implementation due to the GPU support of the shader.

# Running it
To run it you can easily execute it with your instance of the Godot Engine. There are no further dependencies. Another way is to run it directly from your Browser:
